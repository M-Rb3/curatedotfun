# How to Submit
To submit, just tag `@curatedotfun` with the `#hashtag` for the feed you want to submit to.

Then, wait for a curator (check the curator list in feed settings) to click `#approve` as a reply to your post or from a different channel.

You will then receive a message confirming that your post was successfully submitted, along with a link to the app with that reference in the feed.
